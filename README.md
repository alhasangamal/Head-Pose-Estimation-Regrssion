# Head-Pose-Estimation-Regrssion

**In this Script, We will develop a python program that is able to predict The angels head postion (Yaw, Pitch, Roll) and draw the axies which represnt angels**

## Steps

1- Imports Libraries

2- Get Paths of all images

3- Get Landmarks and angels from images and save them in csv file

4- Read and Perpare Data

5- Train models for each angels 

6- using Stander Scale and PCA and RandomForestRegressor to built models

7- test and improve model to make best fit

8- Save models as pickel file

9- import models and try them with live camera

## Libraries 
1- mediapipe

2- cv2

3- numpy

4- pandas

5- mat4py

6- math
